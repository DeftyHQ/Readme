## DEFTY
DEFTY is an open source platform to exchange debt contracts.

## Description
Defty is a relayer that enables peer to peer trading of Collateral Debt Positions. 
We built a ERC721 wrapping contract to ease the transfer of ownership between users and be able to use the NFT infrastructure, including 0x relayers.

## Development status
Currently, we have the wrapping contract deployed on Kovan Testnet. 
### Next steps :
Audit the wrapping contract.
Launch a dedicated relayer.

## How it works ?

Step 1 : Prove ownership 🗝
This step proves that you're the real owner of the CDP.

Step 2: Transfer Ownership 🔀
This step transfers ownership of your CDP to our DEFTY contract.

Step 3: Mint Your Token 💰
This step mints a new NFT token representing ownership of the CDP.

Step 4: Trade your CDP with DEFTY or use it within the NFT ecosystem 🌐
Take advantage of marketplaces like opensea.io and rarebits.io or communities like nifty.gallery or tokntalk.club.
