## Goal
Ease access to CDP (Collateral Debt Positions) and improve the liquidity of those assets.

## Abstract
Defty is a contract that lets you create a NFT(ERC 721) that represents a Maker CDP and provides ownership over it. Giving you access to the whole NFT ecosystem (exchange, auctions, wallets…).

## Examples
- Buy, Sell or Exchange your CDP on OpenSea or 
- Exit your CDP without repaying the outstanding DAI balance

## How it works ?
Step 1: Transfer Ownership 🔀
This step transfers ownership of your CDP to our DEFTY contract.

Step 2: Mint Your Token 💰
This step mints a new NFT token representing ownership of the CDP.

Step 3: Enter the NFT Ecosystem 🌐
Take advantage of marketplaces like opensea.io and rarebits.io or communities like nifty.gallery or tokntalk.club.
